Dear Diary,
Today was a journey. Where do I even begin?
First, Amanda swore up and down that her hair is “naturally shiny.” Naturally shiny, or naturally 
greasy
? She’s out here skipping
shampoo
and calling it a lifestyle.
Then Brad had the nerve to tell everyone he’s “building his empire.” Brad, sweetie, you sell
sunglasses
out of your backpack. The only empire you’re building is the one in your imagination.
Oh, and Tina keeps insisting she’s an
introvert
. Tina, if you’re an introvert, then I’m a
rocketScientist
. You’ve been talking so much, even the group chat is praying for a power outage.
Lucas, of course, posted another
gymSelfie
with the caption, “Hard work pays off.” Lucas, the only thing you’re working hard at is finding the perfect angle. If muscles grew from taking selfies, he’d be unstoppable.
And Megan—let me tell you about Megan. She’s all, “I’m radiating
positivity
these days.” Babe, you’re not radiating anything but attitude.
BurningSage
doesn’t cancel out being shady, but sure, keep trying.
Then Sophia made sure to let everyone know, “I’m just naturally confident without
makeup
.” That’s great, Sophia, but maybe we’d all feel more confident with a little bit of effort from you.
And Chase, of course, had to remind everyone he’s “saving the
planet
” by biking everywhere. Chase, we all know you don’t have a car. You’re not saving the environment, you’re just broke.
Honestly, Diary, it’s exhausting being surrounded by these people. How am I the only one here with even a hint of
selfAwareness
? But you know what? It’s fine. Let them live their delusions. I’ll be over here, thriving as usual.
Love always,
The One and Only
